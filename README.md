# Code read examples

 Code examples without notes and with deliberately obscure function, argument and variable names to be used as code reading exercises. Each one comes with a clue in the form of a function call that can be run from the command line.

```
function transform(arg1, arg2) {
  
  ...

  return result
}
```

HT @jacksongabbard for suggesting this format
